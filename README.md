# Monkey

This is a language called _Monkey_ I am building based on the book [Writing
an Interpreter in Go][1] by Thorsten Ball.

[1]: https://interpreterbook.com/

Here are the features of the Monkey language, taken directly from the book:

- C-like syntax
- variable bindings
- integers and booleans
- arithmetic expressions
- built-in functions
- first-class and higher-order functions
- closures
- a string data structure
- an array data structure
- a hash data structure

### Setup

```
$ git clone http://github.com:jwworth/monkey.git
```
